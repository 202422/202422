## Experience 💼

### **Data Intern**  
**[Commonshare](https://www.commonshare.com/)**, Morocco, Tanger (July 2025 - Setpember 2025) 

* The main objective of the internship project was to **design and implement a fully automated ETL pipeline** for company data.

* The pipeline automatically:

  * Extracts company data from the **USDA website** and external company web pages.
  * Cleans and standardizes raw data.
  * Performs **feature engineering using TF-IDF**.
  * Classifies companies based on their products using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models.

* The processed and classified data is stored in a **PostgreSQL database**, organized into structured tables:

  * Company details
  * Contact information
  * Product categories

* **Apache Airflow** is used to automate and schedule the workflow.

* **Apache Spark** enables distributed processing for large-scale data handling.

* The entire system is containerized and deployed using **Docker**.

* The pipeline runs on a **weekly schedule**, ensuring continuously updated and structured datasets.

* The machine learning models achieved **high classification accuracy**, significantly reducing manual data processing.

### **Data Scientist Intern**  
**[Technocolabs Software](https://www.technocolabs.com/)**, India, Remote (Jun 2024 - Aug 2024) 

During this internship, I worked on a project focused on predicting the current status of a startup. The main goal was to classify startups as either Operating, IPO, Acquired, or Closed. To achieve this, I performed a variety of tasks, including:

- cleaning original dataset by deleting redundant and irrelevant information, handling missing data and outliers and date variables transformation. This changed dataset shape from (196 553, 44) to (57 660, 16)
- applying univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis in order to find out insights in data. 
- performing feature engineering by applying log transformation, standardisation, creating 4 new features and encoding variables; 
- oversampling to balance classes by creating over 100 000 new instances
- modelling using algorithms like LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier to achieve accuracy of 0.99 in binary classification and 1.0 in multiclass classification

### **Machine Learning Research Intern**  
**[ENSIAS](https://ensias.um5.ac.ma/)**, Rabat, On site (June 2024 – July 2024)  

During this internship, the project I worked on involved imputing values into datasets with different percentages of missingness (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%). The approach used here was training machine learning and deep learning models on these datasets. Main tasks:

- Implementing an algorithm to convert a time series dataset into sequences of fixed size (10) to prepare it for supervised learning
- Designing an algorithm to systematically scans the dataset to detect all occurrences of TS-MD (Time Series Missing Data) and train a model to impute this missing values
- Training ML/DL models like SVR, RNN, and LSTM on the training set and comparing their performance on test set. SVR performed best, with a median RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) value of 7.473013.
