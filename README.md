## Experience üíº

### **Data Scientist Intern**  
**[Technocolabs Software](https://www.technocolabs.com/)**, India, Remote (Jun 2024 - Aug 2024) 

During this internship, I worked on a project focused on predicting the current status of a startup. The main goal was to classify startups as either Operating, IPO, Acquired, or Closed. To achieve this, I performed a variety of tasks, including:

- cleaning original dataset by deleting redundant and irrelevant information, handling missing data and outliers and date variables transformation. This changed dataset shape from (196 553, 44) to (57 660, 16)
- applying univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis in order to find out insights in data. 
- performing feature engineering by applying log transformation, standardisation, creating 4 new features and encoding variables; 
- oversampling to balance classes by creating over 100 000 new instances
- modelling using algorithms like LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier to achieve accuracy of 0.99 in binary classification and 1.0 in multiclass classification

### **Machine Learning Research Intern**  
**[ENSIAS](https://ensias.um5.ac.ma/)**, Rabat, On site (June 2024 ‚Äì July 2024)  

During this internship, the project I worked on involved imputing values into datasets with different percentages of missingness (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%). The approach used here was training machine learning and deep learning models on these datasets. Main tasks:

- Implementing an algorithm to convert a time series dataset into sequences of fixed size (10) to prepare it for supervised learning
- Designing an algorithm to systematically scans the dataset to detect all occurrences of TS-MD (Time Series Missing Data) and train a model to impute this missing values
- Training ML/DL models like SVR, RNN, and LSTM on the training set and comparing their performance on test set. SVR performed best, with a median RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) value of 7.473013.
